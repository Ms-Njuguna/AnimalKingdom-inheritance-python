# AnimalKingdom-inheritance-python

Build a program that models different animals in a zoo.

## Deliverables

- Base class: Animal (has name, species, sound)
- Subclasses: Lion, Elephant, Parrot — each with unique sounds and behaviors.

---

## Why inheritance here:

You can put common attributes (name, species, sound) in the base class and override methods in subclasses for special behavior.
